# Algorand Ballet

## Oh, hi there!

My name is Alexis and I am a product manager, developer and Algorand enthusiast.

I wanted to share a research project I've been working on with you.

Ballet is an interactive web application that gives you a glimpse into a wallet's "personality" based on their past trackrecord with other wallets, ASAs and Applications.

## Your Benefits
**Your personal benefit** is that this kind of qualitative "smell-test" gives you an extra data-point to make your best-informed decision _before_ interacting with an untrusted wallet. With a qualitative analysis tool like this one there is no need for identity to get that sense of "personality" (which I think is really cool.)

**The benefit to the ecosystem** is that it gives us a way to have "more eyes on the sidewalk"[1] in an effort to make Algorand a safe place for its inhabitants and visitors alike. Just like the eyes of neighbors, shop-keepers and even visitors keep a sidewalk safe by simply watching.

## Transactions and Relationships
To get a better sense of what a wallet has been up to (and with whom and how often), you can easily switch between looking at their  network of transactions and their graph of relationships.

## Rotate Layouts
While you're looking at a wallet's relationships for example, you can quickly rotate through a number of layouts (grid, circular, random, etc.) to get a kind of "three-dimensional image" just the same way you would look at different parts of a person (Eyes, clothing, shoes, body-language.)

## Dig Deeper
- To navigate, you can **double-click** on wallet nodes to dig deeper.
- You can also **click-hold** any node to open their information on algoexplorer.io.

## It's fun!
Again, if anything, it's a lot of fun to explore and discover better questions to ask.

## PS
1. Just to make it clear, this is a personal project of mine.  I  built it because, after going on an actual adventure and wanting to spend a few Algos on NFTs, I felt deeply unsettled how much overt scamming and how little transparency there was. I did NOT FEEL SAFE while trying to buy a single NFT for fun because I had no way of understanding WHO the person (or group) behind the artwork really is. And I had no way to verify if the story they're telling me (The art-market is a great example of how important *the authenticity of the story* is for its value-creation) is actually true. And I had no way to know the people running the "gallery" itself.
2. I decided to release the application fully open-source[^2] and under a permissive license for you to futz around with it and to allow for any ad-hoc security review in case you are unsure if you can trust the website or app.


## Questions
### Important
Please note that I truly don't do well 'talking' to people via text-based group-media like Github, Reddit, Discord, Slack, WhatsApp and even Email.

I do not have the resources for those channels. They just completely and utterly exhausts me.

Thus, please do not feel offended if I don't respond to your messages in those channels. 

Book a call as follows instead!

### Let's talk 
If you have questions the best way to reach me is to talk live:

1. In person, let's get a coffee and take a walk!
2. or via video/audio call on Zoom

To make that easy, here's [my Calendly](https://calendly.com/alexis-rondeau) where you can book a time for us to talk.


## Why _Ballet_?
To [Jane Jacobs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Death_and_Life_of_Great_American_Cities), when New York sidewalks were safe, they gave stage for an...
> "intricate ballet in which the individual dancers and ensembles all have distinctive parts which miraculously reinforce each other and compose an orderly whole."
