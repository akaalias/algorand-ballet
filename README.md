## Why "Ballet"
To [Jane Jacobs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Death_and_Life_of_Great_American_Cities), when New York sidewalks were safe, they gave stage for an...
> "intricate ballet in which the individual dancers and ensembles all have distinctive parts which miraculously reinforce each other and compose an orderly whole."

## Questions
If you have questions the best way to reach me is to talk live: 

1. In person, let's get a coffee and take a walk! 
2. or via video/audio call on Zoom 

To make that easy, here's [my Calendly](https://calendly.com/alexis-rondeau) where you can book a time for us to talk.

### Important
Please note that I truly don't do well 'talking' to people via text-based group-media like Github, Reddit, Discord, Slack, WhatsApp and even Email. 

Unfortunately I do not have the resources for those channels. They just completely and utterly exhausts me.

Thus, please do not feel offended if I don't respond to your messages in those channels. Book a call instead!
