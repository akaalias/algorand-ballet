## Running on other OSes
As of now, my releases will be Mac-only unless there's a strong call for a Windows or Linux version. Let me (see below) and we can work on other platforms together!

## Questions
If you have questions the best way to reach me is to talk live: 

1. In person, let's get a coffee and take a walk! 
2. or via video/audio call on Zoom 

To make that easy, here's [my Calendly](https://calendly.com/alexis-rondeau/let-s-chat-about-algorand-ballet) where you can book a time for us to talk.

### Important
Please note that I truly don't do well 'talking' to people via text-based group-media like Github, Reddit, Discord, Slack, WhatsApp and even Email. 

Unfortunately I do not have the resources for those channels. They just completely and utterly exhausts me.

Thus, please do not feel offended if I don't respond to your messages in those channels. Book a call instead!
